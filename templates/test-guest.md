Hello,

We're so excited to have you attend ROHP this weekend, for our February 24-25 program! We hope this experience serves as a great introduction to life at Cal in general and as a Regents' Scholar. You have been matched with a current Regents' Scholar, who will serve as your 'host' for the night. This will be your official matching for the night of the program.

You have been matched with the following current scholar, who will host you in their on-campus dorm or apartment. Below, you can find their contact information.
